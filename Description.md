# Holiday-Me
Third year group project to create a holiday planner site

The user takes part in a survey that was created using javascript in order to find the ideal holiday location based on their answers.
Using HTML and CSS, each location has its own page which includes a brief description of the area and a link to the location's actual tourism site should the user require more information.

The survey asks the user simple multiple choice questions as shown below;

Based on the answer that is given by the user, a different value will be fed into the javascript file which will then choose which question should be asked next and after enough information is recieved from the user will also decide which locations is best suited.
