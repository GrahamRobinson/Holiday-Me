# Holiday-Me
Third year group project to create a holiday planner site

The user takes part in a survey that was created using javascript in order to find the ideal holiday location based on their answers.
Using HTML and CSS, each location has its own page which includes a brief description of the area and a link to the location's actual tourism site should the user require more information.
